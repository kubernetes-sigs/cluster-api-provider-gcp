# Release Process

## Change milestone

 - Create a new GitHub milestone for the next release
 - Change milestone applier so new changes can be applied to the appropriate release
      - Open a PR in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra to change this [line](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/25db54eb9d52e08c16b3601726d8f154f8741025/config/prow/plugins.yaml#L344)
        - Example PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/16827

## Prepare branch, tag and release notes

 - Update the file `metadata.yaml` if is a major or minor release
 - Submit a PR for the `metadata.yaml` update if needed, wait for it to be merged before continuing, and pull any changes prior to continuing.
 - Create tag with git
   - `export RELEASE_TAG=v0.4.6` (the tag of the release to be cut)
   - `git tag -s ${RELEASE_TAG} -m "${RELEASE_TAG}"`
	 - `-s` creates a signed tag, you must have a GPG key [added to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
   - `git push upstream ${RELEASE_TAG}`
 - `make release` from repo, this will create the release artifacts in the `out/` folder
 - Install the `release-notes` tool according to [instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/cmd/release-notes/README.md)
 - Export GITHUB_TOKEN
 - Run the release-notes tool with the appropriate commits. Commits range from the first commit after the previous release to the new release commit.

## Promote image to prod repo

Promote image
 - Images are built by the [post push images job](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-cluster-api-provider-gcp#post-cluster-api-provider-gcp-push-images)
 - Create a PR in https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io to add the image and tag
   - Example PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/1462
 - Location of image: https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-staging-cluster-api-gcp/GLOBAL/cluster-api-gcp-controller?rImageListsize=30

To promote the image you should use a tool called `cip-mm`, please refer: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/promo-tools/tree/main/cmd/cip-mm

For example, we want to promote v0.3.1 release, we can run the following command:

```console
$ cip-mm --base_dir=$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/k8s.io/k8s.gcr.io --staging_repo=gcr.io/k8s-staging-cluster-api-gcp  --filter_tag=v0.3.1
```
